# Flight-Price-Prediction
  
## Overview
This project aims to predict flight ticket prices using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset with flight features such as airline, source, destination, and departure/arrival times, as well as information about jet fuel price and holiday vacation.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.9
* PySpark 3.4.0

We recommend running this project on cloud computing platforms like Google Colab. These platforms provide pre-configured environments with all the necessary dependencies installed.
Alternatively, you can also run this project on your local machine by installing the dependencies manually.We may provide a Docker image in the future to simplify the setup process.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes one-way flight data collected from Expedia between April 16, 2022, and October 5, 2022. The dataset also includes daily jet fuel prices and information about national holidays, school spring breaks, and summer breaks during this period.
